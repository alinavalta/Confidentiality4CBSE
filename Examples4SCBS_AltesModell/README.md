Example projects for secure component-based software systems

Example projects for specifying, analyzing and verifying the flow of confidential data in component-based software systems that were modelled using the Palladio Component Model (PCM) 

## Edit
In the projects cloudscenario-minimized and iflowexample were undefined references. This leads to abitary results when applying the PCM2Prolog Generator. Therefore a missing LocationAndTamperProtectionsPair was added to the cloudscenario-minimized. And some unused PCM objects were removed form the iflowexample.
